# Requerimientos objetivo:

1) We want to build a mobile application that allows a user to navigate the catalog of artworks exposed by the Art Institute of Chicago API.

2) The user should be able to see a thumbnail and a small description of each artwork in the main screen of the app

3) When clicking on a thumbnail the user must be sent to a detailed screen of the artwork containing a better quality image and more detailed information about the  piece, the author, and any other data you consider might be relevant for the end user

4) The user should be able to save some favorite artworks, and should be able to explore them even after the application is completely closed and reopened
